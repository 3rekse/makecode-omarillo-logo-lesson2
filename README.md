# Turtle Logo - Lesson #1

## Turtle Logo - Lesson #1 @unplugged
**Welcome to coding with Turtle Logo.**

In this lesson you will create your first Turtle Logo program. You will get a turtle showing up in your game console and have it say, "Hello, World!".
![Hello, World!](https://github.com/Mr-Coxall/makecode-arcade-turtle-logo-lesson1/raw/main/assets/hello_world_screenshot.png)

## Step 1
All our programs begin with an ‚á¢``on start``‚á† block. This block runs all the commands that are inside it as soon as the program begins. It has been provided for you below.
```blocks
/**
 * This is the "on start" block
 */
```

## Step 2
Next you will need to create your turtle. To do this you use the ‚á¢``show turtle``‚á† block and place it inside the ‚á¢``on start``‚á† block. This creates the turtle and places it in the middle of the screen.
```blocks
turtle.showTurtle()
```

## Step 3
Now that we have a turtle, you can ask it to say something. Drag out the ‚á¢``turtle says "Hello, World!" ‚äï``‚á† block and place it inside the ‚á¢``on start``‚á† block after the ‚á¢``show turtle``‚á† block.

```blocks
turtle.showTurtle()
turtle.say("Hello, World!")
```
## Step 4
Success!

Notice in the game console to the left, your object said "Hello, World!" for 1 second and then it's words vanish. If you want to run your program again, click the "üîÅ" button on the game console.

## Step 4
**Your Turn**

Get the turtle to say your name!

## Step 5
Done.

You have successfully completed your first lesson in Turtle Logo.
